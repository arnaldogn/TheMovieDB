IÂ´ve used the following external libraries because I didn't want to reinvent the wheel and they are very useful:
- SearchTextField: It makes really easy the ability to show an autocomplete suggestions list. 
- Alamofire:  It provides an interface that simplifies a number of common networking tasks.
- Swinject: a lightweight and very useful dependency injection framework.
- SDWebImage/WebP: an async image downloader with cache support.
- MBProgressHUD: to display an indicator while work is being done in a background thread.
- EasyRealm: to make easier the use of Realm
